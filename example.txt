Open "example.s" and read the comments for information about this program.

To build, run "compile_example.bat" (Windows) or "compile_example.sh"
(Unix-like), which should produce "example.nes".

You will need cc65. You can download it from: http://www.cc65.org/
Place cc65 into a folder called "cc65" within the folder with this example.
The cc65 binaries should be in: cc65/bin/

An optional Python 3 program to build debugging symbols for FCEUX is included.
Python 3 can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org/

I recommend FCEUX or Mesen for debugging.

FCEUX: http://www.fceux.com/
Mesen: https://www.mesen.ca/

The .dbg file produced by the linker will also provide debug symbols for
Mesen, NintendulatorDX and NESICIDE, with no need for the python processing step.


I hope you find this example helpful!
