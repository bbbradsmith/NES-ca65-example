Open "example.s" and read the comments for information about this program.

To build, run "compile_example.bat" (Windows) or "compile_example.sh"
(Unix-like), which should produce "example.nes".
If the make utility is available, you can run "make" with the included Makefile.

You will need cc65. It is available from many package managers,
or otherwise you could download the source and build it for yourself.
On MacOS it's avaiable using Homebrew.

You can download it from: http://www.cc65.org/

For the windows version, the batch file expects cc65 to be placed into a
folder called "cc65" within the folder containing this example.
The cc65 binaries should be in: cc65/bin/

The bash script and Makefile instead expect cc65 to be on your global path,
but you can customize the script or your environment variables to change this location.

An optional Python 3 program to build debugging symbols for FCEUX is included.
Python 3 can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org/

I recommend FCEUX or Mesen for debugging.

FCEUX: http://www.fceux.com/
Mesen: https://www.mesen.ca/

The .dbg file produced by the linker will also provide debug symbols for
Mesen, NintendulatorDX and NESICIDE, with no need for the python processing step.


I hope you find this example helpful!
