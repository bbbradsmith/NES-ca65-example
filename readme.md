# Minimal NES example using ca65

This is a small example program for the NES, intending to demonstrate how to use ca65 to build an NES ROM.
It is a very basic starting point for programming the NES.

There is also a version of this example available to build an FDS disk image for the Famicom Disk System.

* FDS: https://github.com/bbbradsmith/NES-ca65-example/tree/fds

This depends on the CC65 toolchain, though it only uses the ca65 assembler, not the C compiler:
